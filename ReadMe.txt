Happy Bacteria (A Game of Infectious Fun)
By Jonathan Chase

This program makes use of the simplegame.js engine written by Andy Harris, with his permission.

This program was initially intended to show competency with this engine for a project that Mr. Harris
is leading. Due to my interest in physics, it was also to tackle the challenge of mimicking flow through
a viscous liquid, as well as non-laminar flow. I had a great deal of fun with this one.

They key to this game is to infect a bloodstream, eat enough "yums" to grow into a strong colony of 
bacteria, and to eventually be strong enough to overcome the antibodies (mean old Mr. Antibody!). Each
time the Strength bar reaches its maximum (which happens by eating "yums" and avoiding "icks"), the 
colony doubles in size. If it gets big enough, it can overwhelm the antibodies. Until then, the antibodies
can reduce the size and strength of the colony, and even destroy it!
